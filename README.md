rearrange_tiles
===============

A simple javascript based game where the player has to rearrange a set of jumbled tiles in the correct order.

Input:
A 9X9 board with numbers arranges in some random order. 

End condition:
A board contains the numbers from 1-9 in correct order.

Game rules:
1) Player can drag and drop tiles.
2) Dropping a tile will swap the two tiles. (Easy game huh!)

Future improvements:
1) Player has to arrange the tiles within a given time.
2) Difficulty level -> lesser time to arrange

Technical details:
Planning to use 
1)jQuery
2)Backbone.js
3)Underscore.js

No server side.
No plans to host app as of now.
